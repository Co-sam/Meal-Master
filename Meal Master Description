Meal Master is a Python-based restaurant booking project designed to make dining reservations simple, efficient, and accessible online. It allows users to easily browse restaurants, 
check table availability, and book their preferred time slots — all within a clean and user-friendly interface. The project demonstrates how Python can be used to build a real-world 
application that handles input validation, data management, and user interaction. The system ensures that no double bookings occur by managing each reservation securely.This project
is ideal for beginners exploring real-life applications of Python and for students who want to understand how reservation systems work. It covers key programming concepts 
such as file handling, loops, functions, conditionals, and modular coding — all while solving a practical problem.

Features:
-> Online restaurant booking system
-> Real-time availability check
-> User registration and booking management
-> Data storage and retrieval
